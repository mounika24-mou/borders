        <p> Although humans have always been interested in the natural history of the animals they saw around them, <br>
         and made use of this knowledge to domesticate certain species, <br>
        the formal study of zoology can be said to have originated with Aristotle. He viewed animals as living organisms,<br>
        studied their structure and development, and considered their adaptations to their surroundings and the function of their parts. <br>
         The Greek physician Galen studied human anatomy and was one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world, <br>
        but after the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the onset of the Early Middle Ages,<br>
        the Greek tradition of medicine and scientific study went into decline in Western Europe,<br>
        although it continued in the medieval Islamic world.
